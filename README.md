# stm32
In this repository we are all the projects and libraries for the stm32 microcontrollers created by @eletronita.

We have organized the folders by the stm32 series. So we have folders for each of the following series.


STM32F0 Series : to read more about  http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/mmc/FM141/SC1169/SS1574

STM32F1 Series : to read more about  http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/mmc/FM141/SC1169/SS1031

STM32F2 Series : to read more about  http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/mmc/FM141/SC1169/SS1575

STM32F3 Series : to read more about  http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/mmc/FM141/SC1169/SS1576

STM32F4 Series : to read more about  http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/mmc/FM141/SC1169/SS1577

STM32F7 Series : to read more about  http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/mmc/FM141/SC1169/SS1858


So if you want to find libraries or projects for a specific microcontroller,first of all you
have to know what is the series of you microcontroller then you can go in the correspondent 
series folder and search the subfolder of you microcontroller.
